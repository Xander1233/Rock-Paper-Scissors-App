# Rock-Paper-Scissors-App

A simple rock paper scissors app with an extended version from "the big bang theory", which can be found for more details [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8).
The main focus lays on the extended and normal version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, although the app also comes along with a Rules tab, which describes for both version the rules and icons, and a settings tab, which let you change the default theme mode color, reduced motion, and lets you delete the current scores.
The app also includes a history system, which provides the functionality to switch back to older turns as long as the turns are made within the current session.

The player plays against the computer, which plays randomly, and the score between both is stored and loaded between sessions, so you do not loose your score if you close the app.
